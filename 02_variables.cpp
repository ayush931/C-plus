// ! Rules for naming Variables in C++

/* 

* Rule 1:- Variable names should not begain with a number

* Rule 2:- Whitespace is not permitted in variable names.

* Rule 3:- A C++ keyword (reserved word) cannot be used as a variable name.

* Rule 4:- It is preferred to use variable names with more than one word with all lowercase letters for the first word and capitalization of the first letter of the each subsequent word.

* Rule 5:- When creating variables, it is preferred to give them meaningful names.

* Rule 6:- All lowercase letters should be used when creating one-word variable names.

*/

// ! Identifiers:- Identifiers are name of any class, variables, methods, etc.

/*

* Rule 1:- All identifiers should begain with a letter (A to Z or a to z), currency character($) or an underscore(_).

* Rule 2:- After the first character, identifiers can have any combination of characters.

* Rule 3:- A keyword cannot be used as an identifiers.

* Rule 4:- The identifiers are case sensitive.

* Rule 5:- Whitespace is not permitted.
